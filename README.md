# How to add a new theme into this repository

Make sure the theme json is actually valid! You can check it here: https://jsonformatter.org/ 

Theme file extension is "json". Theme file name must end with the theme type (light or dark), e.g. "example-theme-light.json" if it's a light theme and "example-theme-dark.json" if it's a dark theme. Try not to use whitespaces/unicode symbols in the file name.

1. **Your theme must be unique**! Meaning, if you copy an existing theme and change a couple of colors **IT MOST LIKELY WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!** Why? Because I don't want to bloat this repository with billions of variants of the Tomorrow theme.
2. Fork this repo.
3. Create a new branch, then create a file with your theme, modify it, commit, push.
