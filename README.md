# How to add a new theme into this repository

1. **Your theme must be unique**! Meaning, if you copy an existing theme and change a couple of colors **IT MOST LIKELY WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!** Why? Because I don't want to bloat this repository with billions of variants of the Tomorrow theme.
2. Fork this repo.
3. Create a new branch, then create a file with your theme, modify it, commit, push.

Make sure the theme json is actually valid! You can check it here: https://jsonformatter.org/
